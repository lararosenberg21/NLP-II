Los ajustes de temperatura, muestreos por top-n y top-k no lograron mejorar sustancialmente el contenido que se generaba. Si activabamos la eleccion de token greedy, veíamos que el texto repetia siempre la misma palabra: \"the\".\n",

        "- Con respecto a la visualización de la atención, vemos que hay casos con layers y heads donde la atención es dispersa, lo cual puede sugerir que el modelo está tratando de aprender relaciones globales en la secuencia (ej:layer 1 head 1). Tambien vemos casos donde la atención es más concentrada en ciertas posiciones, lo que podría indicar que el modelo está enfocándose principalmente en ciertas partes de la secuencia (por ejemplo, layer 1 head 3).\n"
